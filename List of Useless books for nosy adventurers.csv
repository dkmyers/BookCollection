Quantum Sound And Psychoacoustics: The Superiority Of The Pentatonic Scale ,"A thick and rumpled tome stuffed with extra slips of note paper. Both front and back are covered with graphs, equations, and  illustrations of a human's inner ear. ","A bard's near-manic explaination about how one could mathematically calculate where a new octive would start, in any key, by finding the frequency of sound vibrations and multiplying or dividing by two, to create a perfectly-overlapped frequency without disortions. One chapter dives into how 'Octaves' and what sounded pleasing to the human ear, while they did have some consistent notes like middle-C and base-2 pairs creating a good harmony, other 'octave sets' and intervals between notes were largely defined by the culture you learned music in. There are several chapters dedicated to proving the 'note-steps' increase on a logarithmic scale that appears exponential as you reach the highest frequencies of pitch. Her descriptions become even more harried as she mapped the actual frequency increase between notes in several octaves, to show that the ratio-of-change from the first to second note, second to third, third to fourth, and so on, was always the same when building a single octave. (12, 13, 7.5, 16, 18, 20, 11 are repeated several times, and there's several loose pages of graphing paper displaying this ratio across both major and minor keys.  The author then goes on to extrapolate on how we rarely heard a perfect tone, since the air's gas composition interferes with it, so the actual frequency of a tone in reality (not just theoretical) is not a single steady sine wave (which is only used for ease-of-explaination), but rather one that had instances of both longer and shorter wavelengths within it to create quantum-frequency, but the inner ear was able to organically collapse this 'quantum' representation of many possibilities of sound into a single stream that people then perceived, which is not quite the same as how two frequencies overlapping could create a phantom third sound, from where the wavelengths clashed as they overlapped imperfectly.  There's a lot more about the theory of frequency sensitivity and how our non-logarithmic sensitivity to decibals meant that we'd never be able to perceive sound in its mathematically 'truest' state, asserting that the Pentatonic scale was the most mathematically perfect way to create a key (since its frequency shift when traced on a line accounted for a 'sharp/flat' note between E to F, and B to C that western scales skipped) but honestly you have other priorities right now and should move on from this book. "

There's a well-illustrated guide of different fashion trends throughout the last three decades, with notes on the specific height of hats, length of robes, and even types of fabrics used.  Despite the disdainful commentary inserted into descriptions regarding her clientelle, the book is incredibly thorough and well-researched."

","The rich plot of the second book has been dropped entirely, and your favorite character inexplicably moved to another continent. This book is full of incredibly detailed (and, admittedly, well-written) sex scenes, but is lacking any narraritive substance.  The dillema facing the dentist appears to be ""which position is best to bring my partner to completion"", and not the ethical and social hierarchy considerations from the second book. "
